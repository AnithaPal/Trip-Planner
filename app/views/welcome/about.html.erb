  <p class="text-justify about-paragraph"> Triplanner is a trip planning application which helps to organize trips by
    inviting friends and creating poll questions about where do they want to go
    and what they want to do in a trip. There is also a polling feature, that helps
    to decide based on number of votes. After a trip, it also helps in expense
    determination among friends. It calculates each person share based on how much
    they spent on the trip.
