->##TriPlanner<-

TriPlanner is a trip planning application which helps to organize trips by inviting friends and creating poll questions about where do they want to go and what they want to do in a trip. There is also a polling feature, that helps to decide based on number of votes. After a trip, it also helps in expense determination among friends. It calculates each person share based on how much they spent on the trip.
